## A description of the project

A Dungeons and Dragons (D and D) companion app, suitable for users with no knowledge of D and D right through to experienced players. Users can access the main app without logging on, however, upon logging in they can create characters and save their attributes.

## The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems

Individuals who are new to D and D and advanced players (plus everyone in-between) need an easy to use, approachable app where they can:

- Create and save a character
- Roll dice virtually
- (For beginner players) Learn about the game

We solved these problems by:

- Having a ‘Create a character’ page where users can create, update, save and delete their characters
- A virtual dice roll page which features different types of die
- An intro page with a quick intro video and some guidance on how to use the app
